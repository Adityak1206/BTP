                In this project, there will be two login interfaces one for faculty and another for students.
                Students Interface:As students log in, they will get a dashboard where they can update their profile,
                and then they will get a filter to select their area of interest. After selecting their area of interest 
                they will get a list of all the faculties which are working in that particular area. If a student selects
                a particular faculty he/she will get an option to arrange an in-person meeting with the faculty,
                a request will be sent to the faculty with a 200 words snippet giving a brief overview of their project.
                If faculty likes the idea then can accept the meet request and set the day and time of the meeting according
                to their availability. This meeting option will not be available to the students for those faculties,
                whose slots are already filled.
                Faculty Interface:As Faculty log in, they will get a dashboard where they can update their profile with
                their area of research and past projects. When students send them request they will get an option to 
                accept or deny the request. After the faculty approves the project, the count of students which the faculty
                can take will decrease. After all the projects under a faculty are finalized faculty can see their ongoing 
                projects and will also be able to update the progress bar of a particular project.
